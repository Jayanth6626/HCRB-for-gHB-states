Numerical evaluation of the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound (HCRB) for generalized Holland-Burnett (gHB) states. This code is adapted from the `HCRB` function of the [QuanEstimation](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation) package and optimized to yield efficient results for the gHB states, an important class of two-mode definite photon number states, especially at higher photon numbers. This code was used to compute the HCRB, supporting the results of the arXiv paper: [Measurement compatibility in multiparameter quantum interferometry](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.18324).
