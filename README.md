Numerical evaluation of the Holevo Cramér-Rao bound for generalized Holland-Burnett (gHB) states. This code is adapted from the `HCRB` function of the [QuanEstimation](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation) package and optimized to yield efficient results for the gHB states, an important class of two-mode definite photon number states, especially at higher photon numbers.
