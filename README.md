# HCRB-for-gHB-states
Numerical evaluation of the Holevo Cram√©r-Rao bound for generalized Holland-Burnett states. This code is adapted from the `HCRB` function of the [QuanEstimation](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation) package and optimized to yield efficient results for multiphoton Fock states in higher dimensions.
