Numerical evaluation of the Holevo Cram√©r-Rao bound for generalized Holland-Burnett states. This code is adapted from the `HCRB` function of the [QuanEstimation](https://github.com/QuanEstimation/QuanEstimation) package and optimized to yield efficient results for an important class of multiphoton Fock states especially at higher photon numbers.
